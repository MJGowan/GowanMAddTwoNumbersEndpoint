Add Two Numbers - Endpoint
In this we will add two numbers, now in a way that is compatible with postman

Peer review: Ulises Ortega, the code is clean works as expected, I test it in ost man and it ouput the addition of the numbers, good Job!

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
https://localhost:xxxx/MathStuffs/Adding/x/x
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /MathStuffs/Adding, and in the next two spaces I have labelled x, you will enter numbers of your choice Then, hit "Send". Text should then appear with the sum of your two numbers.
